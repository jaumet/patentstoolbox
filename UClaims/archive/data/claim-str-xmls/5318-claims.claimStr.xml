<claim gate:gateId="1" id="CLM-00001" body="a power assisted steering system of a vehicle, the method comprising:
receiving at least two signals from at least two sensors of the power assisted steering system, each of the signals corresponding to at least one of a vehicle speed, a longitudinal acceleration, a lateral acceleration, and a vertical acceleration, wherein the two signals are different;
allowing unimpeded steering within a permissible steering rack travel that is based on at least one of the vehicle speed, the longitudinal acceleration, the lateral acceleration, and the vertical acceleration;
when a steering rack position has reached a boundary of the permissible steering rack travel, providing counter assist torque to prohibit movement of a steering rack of the vehicle beyond the permissible steering rack travel;
when the steering rack position has exceeded the permissible steering rack travel, providing counter assist torque to return the steering rack of the vehicle to a position within the permissible steering rack travel; and
further comprising, if the vehicle speed is less than a predetermined speed, setting the permissible steering rack travel to an optimum steering rack travel;
wherein the optimum steering rack travel is based on at least the vehicle speed, a suspension travel, the longitudinal acceleration, the lateral acceleration, and the vertical acceleration.
