means for braking at least one of said wheels;
means for connecting said platform to said elongated body, which define for said platform a rotation axis substantially orthogonal to said supporting surface, thereby allowing a rotation of said foot relative to said movement direction, between a first position, wherein in said first position said foot is substantially parallel to said movement direction, and a second position, wherein in said second position said foot is incident on said movement direction; and
control means responsive to the rotation of said foot around said rotation axis and adapted to operate said braking means when said foot is arranged in a braking position corresponding to said second position.
