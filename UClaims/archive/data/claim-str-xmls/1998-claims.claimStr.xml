<claim gate:gateId="1" id="CLM-00001" body="an elliptic crucible, the apparatus comprising:
a chamber filled with heat-insulating material;
a heating element fixedly installed inside the heat-insulating material;
an elliptic crucible located inside the heating element, to accommodate raw material of sapphire single crystals, and having a horizontal cross section in an elliptic shape;
a support member configured to prevent the crucible from drooping down due to a weight of the accommodated material; and
a stand located on an upper end of the support member to allow the crucible to be put on the stand,
wherein a seed crystal is positioned such that a horizontal direction of a C-axis is provided in a long-axis direction of the ellipse, and a vertical direction of the C-axis is provided in a short-axis direction of the ellipse, and
wherein the heating element is divided into a short-axis heating element located outside the crucible in the short-axis direction, and a long-axis heating element located outside the crucible in the long-axis direction.
