<claim gate:gateId="1" id="CLM-00001" body="a polyoxyalkylene derivative represented by the following general formula (1):


Z (OA) n -OH] m  (1)


wherein Z is a residue of glycerin or diglycerin, OA is an oxyalkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, n is an average number of moles of the oxyalkylene group added and is 80 to 800, and m is 3 to 4,
the method comprising:
step (A): a step of removing water from glycerin or diglycerin at 90° C. to 170° C. under 3 kPa or lower;
step (B): a step of adding metal sodium or metal potassium as an alkali catalyst in an amount of 0.015 to 1.6% by weight based on the amount of glycerin or diglycerin charged in the step (A) and dissolving the metal at 20 to 110° C.;
step (C): a step of subjecting an alkylene oxide to addition reaction at 50° C. to 110° C. until the average number n of moles of the oxyalkylene group OA added reaches 1 to 10;
step (D): a step of adding an alkali catalyst represented by the following general formula (2) in an amount of 2 to 50% by weight based on glycerin or diglycerin charged in the step (A):


R—OW  (2)


wherein R is a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 4 hydrocarbons and W represents either sodium or potassium;
step (E): a step of carrying out alcohol removal at 90 to 130° C. under 15 kPa or lower; and
step (F): a step of subjecting an alkylene oxide to addition reaction at 100° C. to 130° C. until the average number n of moles of the oxyalkylene group OA added reaches 80 to 800.
