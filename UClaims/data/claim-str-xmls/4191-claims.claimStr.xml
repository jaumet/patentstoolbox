<claim gate:gateId="1" id="CLM-00001" body="device comprising:
a lens mounting member to which at least one lens is installed;
a guiding member that guides movement of the lens mounting member;
a driver that moves the lens mounting member and includes a lead screw;
an operation member installation unit that is formed at an end of the lens mounting member and has first and second end portions;
an operation member that includes a screw unit that contacts the lead screw, an installation unit that has first and second end portions and is installed to the operation member installation unit, and a connection unit connecting the screw unit and the installation unit; and
an elastic member including a first end that contacts the installation unit and a second end that contacts the operation member installation unit, wherein the elastic member is configured in both a shape of a compression coil spring and a shape of a torsion coil spring and exerts both compression elasticity that pushes the operation member with respect to the operation member installation unit, and torsional elasticity that pushes the screw unit toward a base unit of the operation member installation unit;
wherein the connection unit extends from the operation member installation unit toward the lead screw to connect the screw unit and the installation unit,
a first propping member that contacts the first end portion of the installation unit, while the operation member moves along the lead screw and prevents tilting of the operation member, is formed on the first end portion of the operation member installation unit, and
at least one second propping member is formed on the second end of the operation member installation unit, protrudes toward the screw unit further than the second end portion of the installation unit, contacts a portion of the connection unit, and prevents tilting of the operation member.
