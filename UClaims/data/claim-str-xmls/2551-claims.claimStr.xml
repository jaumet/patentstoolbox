<claim gate:gateId="1" id="CLM-00001" body="a multiwell plate, the multiwell plate having a plurality of wells, each of the wells having an opening and a base surface;
an insert plate, the insert plate having a plurality of inserts positioned to align with a corresponding one of the wells whereby the insert plate can be coupled to the multiwell plate with each insert disposed in the corresponding well;
each of the inserts including:
a supply port arranged for flow communication with a supply source;
an exhaust port;
a bottom portion;
a gas permeable membrane secured to the bottom portion; and
a flow channel formed between the gas permeable membrane and the bottom portion of the insert, the flow channel providing flow communication between the supply port and the exhaust port; and

wherein at least one of the inserts further includes:
a second supply port arranged for flow communication with a second supply source;
a second exhaust port; and
a second flow channel formed between the gas permeable membrane and the bottom portion of the insert, the second flow channel providing flow communication between the second supply port and the second exhaust port, the second supply port connectable to a second supply source;

wherein the first flow channel and the second flow channel are separated from one another by a boundary; and
each of the inserts having a length sized to position the gas permeable membrane a desired distance from the base surface of the multiwell plate when the multiwell plate and the insert plate are coupled to one another.
