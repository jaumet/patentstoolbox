A bunch of visualization ideas to work with patent texts. 

This is an academic project started on August 2013.

By the moment we cannot tell you more about it because we are in a brainstorming phase. We hope to publish some info very soon.
In case you are involved in patents analysis and/or patents visualization, we will be happy to know about it, please let as a comment.

Thanks for your interest in this project.
